# Reqres API Tests

This Postman collection contains a set of automated tests for the Reqres REST API. The tests include positive and negative test cases for typical CRUD operations over one or more resources managed by the API.

## Precondition
1. Install [Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/).

2. Import this collection into your Postman application.

## Running the Tests

3. Open the collection, and you'll see folders named after the HTTP methods (Create, Get, Update, Delete).

4. To run a test, click the "Send" button. Postman will send the request to the API.

7. After the request is sent, Postman will display the test results in the "Tests" tab. You'll see if the test cases pass or fail.

8. Review the test results to ensure that the API operations behave as expected.

9. You can execute the tests individually or run the entire collection.
