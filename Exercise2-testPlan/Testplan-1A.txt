Feature: Reqres API Tests
  As a QA engineer,
  I want to test the Reqres API endpoints,
  So that I can ensure the API functions correctly.

  Background:
    Given the Reqres API is accessible

    Scenario: Create an User Endpoint
      When a POST request is sent to the "/api/register" endpoint with the following data:
        | username | email          | password  |
        | hello    | hi@gmail.com   | passTest  |
      Then the response should have a status code of 400 Bad Request
      And the response should not have a status code of 200 Success
      And the response should contain the expected error message "Note: Only defined users succeed registration"

    Scenario: Create an User with Invalid Email
      When a POST request is sent to the "/api/register" endpoint with invalid email:
        | username | email         | password  |
        | user1   | invalid_email  | pass123  |
      Then the response should have a status code of 400 Bad Request
      And the response should contain the error message "Note: Only defined users succeed registration"

      Scenario: Create an User with Empty Username
      When a POST request is sent to the "/api/register" endpoint with the following data:
        | username | email          | password  |
        |         | test@example.com | pass123  |
      Then the response should have a status code of 400 Bad Request
      And the response should contain the error message "Note: Only defined users succeed registration"

    Scenario: Get Users Endpoint
      When a GET request is sent to the "/api/users?page=3&per_page=2" endpoint
      Then the response should have a status code of 200 OK
      And the response should be in JSON format
      And the response should contain 2 users (per_page=2)
      And the response page number should be 3
      And the id in the first object of data array should be 5

      Scenario: Get Users with Invalid Page Number
      When a GET request is sent to the "/api/users?page=invalid&per_page=2" endpoint
      Then the response should have a status code of 400 Bad Request
      And the response should contain an error message

    Scenario: Update User Endpoint
      When a PUT request is sent to the "/api/users/3" endpoint with the following data:
        | email                |
        | maria.wong@reqres.in |
      Then the response should have a status code of 200 OK
      And the response should contain the 'updatedAt' attribute
      And the response should contain the 'email' attribute

      Scenario: Update Non-Existent User
      When a PUT request is sent to the "/api/users/100" endpoint with valid data:
        | email               |
        | updated@example.com |
      Then the response should have a status code of 404 Not Found

    Scenario: Update User with Invalid Email Format
      When a PUT request is sent to the "/api/users/3" endpoint with an invalid email format:
        | email            |
        | invalid-email    |
      Then the response should have a status code of 400 Bad Request
      And the response should contain an error message

    Scenario: Delete a User Endpoint
